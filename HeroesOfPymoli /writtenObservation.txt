Written Observations:

1. Women outspend men per person, and both catagories are outspent by the 'Other' category. This highlights the importance of marketing games to more than just men.

2. While those in the 20-24 age group make up the greatest number of transactions, those <10 and from 35-39 actually outspend them per person. 

3. The cheaper items are not more likely to be purchased. In fact, The highest purchase counts are for items in the higher end of the price range.
